- Handle errors and provide appropriate error messages and status codes -> DONE

Level 3:

- Implement security measures to protect against common security threats such as SQL
  injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks
- Optimize the API for scalability and performance, able to handle a large number of
  requests and traffic
